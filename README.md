# react-to-do
Basic To-Do app written in ReactJS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To install:
1) Checkout this repo
2) run "npm install" in the root folder of the checkout
3) npm start

This should open a new tab in your browser pointing at localhost. If not, try going to: http://localhost:3000/]

This is a pretty basic intro for myself to React. I took the Code School intro to React course on a Saturday,
and wrote this on a Sunday. Ah, the hobbies of geeks! So, my React knowledge is pretty basic at this point, but
I'm sharing here in case it might be of value to anyone else.

The meat of the app is in /src/App.js

Enjoy!
